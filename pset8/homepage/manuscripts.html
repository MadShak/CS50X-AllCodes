            <h2>Manuscripts</h2>

            <p>After the death of Simone Bou√©, Cioran's companion for much of her life, a series
            of manuscripts (about 30 notebooks), written by him, were found by a dealer in the apartment where
            lived, and this man tried to auction them off in 2005. However, by decision of the Paris Court of Appeal, his
            commercialization was forbidden; this process is still pending in France. Among these manuscripts, in their
            most drafts of work already published, an unpublished diary was found, describing his life after 1972
            (year in which the notebooks are closed). The document is of great interest to readers and editors, and is
            probably Cioran's last unpublished work.</p>
