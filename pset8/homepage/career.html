            <h2>Career in France</h2>

            <p>The year 1937 saw Cioran's departure for France, having won a scholarship at the Institut 
            Français in Bucharest. From the moment of his departure, Cioran published only books in French (which were highly 
            appreciated, not only for their content, but also for their style full of lyricism and the sophistication of the 
            language). In fact, he refused to write in Romanian, accentuating the detachment from his country to such an extent 
            that even letters sent to family members were written in French. In 1949, he published his first book in French, 
            Précis de Decomposition (Breviary of Decomposition), by Gallimard - publisher who would later publish most of his 
            books - and was awarded the Rivarol Prize in 1950. Later, Cioran became refuse all literary awards that were 
            conferred on it. Cioran established permanent residence in the Latin Quarter of Paris. He lived most of his life 
            in isolation, avoiding contact with the public. Despite this, he had many friends, with whom he often spoke, such 
            as Mircea Eliade, Eugène Ionesco, Paul Celan, Samuel Beckett and Henri Michaux.</p>
