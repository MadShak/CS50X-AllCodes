            <h1>Hello World, Im Cioran...</h1>
            
            
            <h2>Berlin n Romania</h2>

            <p>In 1933, he won a scholarship to the University of Berlin, where he had contact with Nicolai Hartmann
            and Ludwig Klages. In Berlin, he is interested in the actions of the Nazi regime, and collaborates with a column by Vremea
            addressing the subject (then Cioran confesses: "there is currently no politician that arouses greater sympathy and admiration
            than Hitler, "[1] and praises the Night of the Long Knives -" what would humanity have to lose if the lives of some
            imbeciles were suppressed? "), and, in a letter addressed to Petru Comarnescu, describes himself as a" Hitler ". Cioran
            had a similar view on Italian fascism. He saluted the victories of the Second Italo-Abisínia War,
            that: "Fascism is a shock, without which Italy is a compromise compared to Romania today". The first book
            de Cioran, Sur les cimes du désespoir (At the height of despair, translated more precisely as: "In the summits of
            Despair ") was published in Romania in 1934 and awarded the Commissions Prize and the Young Writers Prize
            as being one of the best books written by an unprecedented young author. They followed: The Book of Disillusions (1935),
            The Transfiguration of Romania (1936) and Lágrimas e Santos (1937), also published in Romania. Although it was not
            effective member in Romania, Cioran began to take an interest in the ideas propagated by Iron Guard, a
            ultra-right organization, whose nationalist ideology he supported until the beginning of World War II,
            despite supposedly disapproving of his violent methods. Later he denies that movement which he approached
            in youth, criticizing right-wing and fascist movements as being passions and diseases of youth.</p>
