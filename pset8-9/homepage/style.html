            <h2>Style and Main Themes</h2>

            <p>His works often portrayed an atmosphere of torment and torture, situations that Cioran lived 
            through and that came to be dominated by lyricism, always prone to expressing violent feelings. The books he 
            wrote in Romanian when he was young are more identified with this characteristic. Concerned about the issue of 
            death and suffering, he was attracted to the idea of ​​suicide, believing that this was an idea that could help an 
            individual to continue living, an idea that he explored deeply in his book "Sur les cimes du désespoir" 
            (Summits of Despair). The theme of the alienation of man, the most prominent of the existential themes 
            presented by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, is formulated, in 1932, by the young Cioran: "Would existence 
            be our exile and emptiness our homeland?". Cioran's works also cover many other themes such as: original sin, the 
            tragic meaning of history, the end of civilization, the denial of consolidation by faith, the obsession of the 
            absolute, life with the expression of man's metaphysical exile, etc. He was a passionate thinker of history, who 
            studied deeply at the University; read the authors related to the periods considered "decadent". Authors like 
            Oswald Spengler influenced Cioran's political philosophy by offering Gnostic reflections on the destiny of man 
            and civilizations. According to Cioran: "once man keeps in touch with his origins and does not dissociate from 
            himself, he resists decay. Today, man moves towards his own destruction through self-objectification, through 
            production and impeccable reproduction, the excess of self-analysis and transparency, through an artificial 
            triumph ".</p>
